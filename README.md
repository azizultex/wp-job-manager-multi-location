# wp-job-manager-multi-location
It wasn't possible to add more than one marker or locations to a listing in WP Job Manager with WP Job Manager extended location plugin. This plugin make this happen. You can simply install and activate it. No other changes required. You will see multi location add button to add as many locations as you need for the listing. 

The multi location plugin adds the ability to add as many markers as you want both in frontend for users and backend for admin. Multi location markers shows in single listing page as well as in the explore or search map.
